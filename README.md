📈 Stock Price Prediction using KNN
<br>
This project predicts stock prices using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset is fetched using the yfinance library, and the model is built using scikit-learn.

🚀 Overview
<br>
This project uses historical stock data from yfinance to predict future stock prices.
The KNN algorithm predicts the stock price based on the similarity of data points (neighbors).
Performance is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
